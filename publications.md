### rcpptimer: Rcpp Tic-Toc Timer with OpenMP Support

We developed 'cpptimer', a straightforward tic-toc timer class for benchmarking C++ code to address this. Unlike existing solutions, 'cpptimer' supports overlapping timers and OpenMP parallelism. It also calculates summary statistics when benchmarking the same code segment multiple times. Being a header-only library, 'cpptimer' is easily bindable to higher-level languages.

### Online Distributional Regression, 2025, Simon Hirsch, Jonathan Berrisch, Florian Ziel

We present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.

### Multivariate Probabilistic CRPS Learning with an Application to Day-Ahead Electricity Prices, 2023, Jonathan Berrisch & Florian Ziel

We apply CRPS Learning to multivariate data. We extend the smoothing methods proposed in the original CRPS Learning paper and we apply the methodology to probabilistic forecasts of multivariate day-ahead electricity prices.

### Modeling volatility and dependence of European carbon and energy prices, 2023, Jonathan Berrisch & Sven Pappert & Antonia Arsova & Florian Ziel

We developed a VECM-GARCH-COPULA model for EUA, coal, natural gas and oil prices. We use maximum likelihood to estimate the model parameters and forecast the prices in a one-step process.

### High-Resolution Peak Demand Estimation Using Generalized Additive Models and Deep Neural Networks, 2022, Jonathan Berrisch & Michal Narajewski & Florian Ziel

This paper presents a method for estimating high-resolution electricity peak demand given lower resolution data.
